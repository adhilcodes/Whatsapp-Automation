# Whatsapp-Automation
This is a python code to automate whatsapp text messages, ie; this code is used to send text message to anyone who is not even in your contact list . I have used " selenium " library  for this. To use this code you need to install proper version of chromedriver or equivalent firefox tool in your PC.
here is the selenium documentation : https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started/
here is the chromiumdriver official website : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
